            <td width="50%">Online shopping has been known as a rapidly growing business, and although online grocery shopping has not followed these same growth patterns in the past, it is now being recognized for its potential. As such, the focus of previous online shopping research has seldom encompassed this specific retail market, with the existing studies focusing essentially on consumers’ motivations and attitudes, rather than how consumers actually shop for groceries online. Therefore, this dissertation has the objective of uncovering some of the details of consumer decision making processes for this specific online retail market, details which can help further both academic research and managerial knowledge. <br><br> The general consumer decision making process is characterized by a pre-decisional, a decisional and a post-decisional phase. All of which were addressed in an exploratory fashion, through a mixed methods strategy which combined both quantitative and qualitative methods of data collection. <br><br>One of the main results obtained through this study is the complementarity of retail channels - as it was found that online grocery shopping serves essentially for major shopping trips, being complemented with smaller trips to traditional stores. <br><br>The supermarket typically has places for fresh meat, fresh produce, dairy, deli items, baked goods, and similar foodstuffs. Shelf space is also reserved for canned and packaged goods and for various non-food items such as kitchenware, household cleaners, pharmacy products and pet supplies. Some supermarkets also sell other household products that are consumed regularly, such as alcohol (where permitted), medicine, and clothing, and some sell a much wider range of non-food products: DVDs, sporting equipment, board games, and seasonal items (e.g., Christmas wrapping paper, Easter eggs, school uniforms, Valentine's Day themed gifts, Mother's Day gifts, Father's Day gifts and Halloween).bg-body-tertiaryA larger full-service supermarket combined with a department store is sometimes known as a hypermarket. Other services may include those of banks, cafés, childcare centers/creches, insurance (and other financial services), mobile phone sales, photo processing, video rentals, pharmacies, and gas stations. If the eatery in a supermarket is substantial enough, the facility may be called a "grocerant", a portmanteau of "grocery" and "restaurant"</td>
